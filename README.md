put Yii into the main folder (could probably just point to where it is located on your server in your index.php) - edit the db.php config file (protected/config/db.png) here you will put the name of the database and your username and password where applicable - get the db files out of protected/modules/install/data (import schema into your database first ) -If you encounted any errors( edit protected/config/production.php by commenting out the db array (from about line 20 to 29 ) - refreshed app - loggin with the preset information and enjoy
